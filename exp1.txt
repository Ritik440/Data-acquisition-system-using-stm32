To do some experiment and obtain some result you will need the following:-

        1. A power supply (A symmetrical supply is preferred)
        2. An external circuit that can act as a voltage-dependent voltage source to use Analog out (–1.65 V to +1.65 V) of MCU to generate higher voltage (say –10 V to +10 V) to sweep voltage                  between these values.
        3. Use the Vref of the device as ground for external circuit.
        4. Connect the voltages to be measured to the input channels of the device.


On the device:-
    - Choose F3 in the menu
    - Choose appropriate TimeBase (100 ms or 50 ms)
    - Connect the USB to PC

On the PC software
    - Choose the COM port and baud rate (115200) and connect
    - Choose folder to save the file, choose "Sweep" mode, choose N as 10, so that 10 sheets will be averaged to remove external unwanted noise.
    - Press Record then Trigger, the device will start sweeping 10 times.
    - After sweeping is done press Stop, the file will be saved.
    - Press "Average" and select the file, an averaged sheet will be created by taking the average of all 10 sheets.

Open the file created
  - To calculate the current through the LED:-
        current = (voltage across the series resistor) / (value of the resistor)
  - Current is plotted against LED voltage
